# MNIST Digit Recognition - Convolutional Neural Networks

Dataset: https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/

I implemented a CNN model using Keras to recognize handwritten digits. Starting with a single convolution layer, I added a dense layer on top of it with ReLU activation, as well as a dense layer for calculating the softmax output for classification. I experiment with training time (epochs), learning rates, tuning the number of convolution and maxpooling layers, as well as adding a dropout layer to prevent overfitting and improve model performance. 

The best accuracy on the test set was found to be 99.10%.
